## Inspiration

I watched [THE 7 HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE BY STEPHEN COVEY - ANIMATED BOOK REVIEW][youtube_video] presented by [FightMediocrity][author_page] on [YouTube][youtube_url] this morning and I felt inspired.  In general, I hear that habits take 18 days to form, give or take depending on your source.

I'm going to take a set of Habits I want to focus on and repeat them for 18 days, documenting <!--more--> my journey along the way.

## What is the purpose of this challenge?

I want to build a habit.  Plain and simple.  The habit I want to build is a habit of continuously improving myself.  Honestly, I'm not the person clicking the "3 Ways To Be A Better Blah...".  I don't believe it.  

There is so much advice on how to do things better that I must ignore it.  I'm going to take a different path, rather than reading a bunch of articles on how to improve myself, I'm going to actually do something.

## How will I do it?

My plan is fairly simple, I'm going to write a post each day for 18 days describing how I will, or have, executed on each habit.  I have chosen a set of habits to track based on the video.

## Habits

* Habit 1: Be Proactive
* Habit 2: Begin with the end in mind
* Habit 3: Put first things first
* Habit 4: Think win-win
* Habit 5: Seek first to understand, then to be understood
* Habit 6: Synergize
* Habit 7: Sharpen the saw
