## Status

Day 7: I am attending the [Kansas City Developer Conference][KCDC] today.  The first day was really great.  I learned quite a bit from the sessions and it was nice to talk with all the sponsors and the people they had representing them at the conference.

For those reading this post who haven't read WHY I'm blogging about these 7 habits, hop over to the [challenge post][challenge_blog_post] where I describe what I'm trying to do.

### Habit 1: Be Proactive

I took the opportunity to attend some sessions where the topic was something outside of my field.  I think it is important to understand as much as possible about a multitude of topics and schools of thought because they all seem to come back together.

### Habit 2: Begin with the end in mind

Tough one...I took notes of what I thought were key points from each session in order to remember what I could share with our team.

### Habit 3: Put first things first

I took myself for a long run today.  It hurt.

### Habit 4: Think win-win

At the conference I connected with a couple of booths that I felt like I may have something to share.  We discussed a couple of topics that we could work on presenting to a user group.

### Habit 5: Seek first to understand, then to be understood

I talked to a college senior about career paths and choices.  I focused on understanding what his goals were and what type of career he wanted before I gave any advice.

### Habit 6: Synergize

In my conversations with people that I met a the conference we talked about how we could team up to present a couple topics to a user group.

### Habit 7: Sharpen the saw

I spent my day at [Kansas City Developer Conference][KCDC] attending sessions that provided a new perspective on how we develop software and improve our skill of the craft.
